# PenguorHS

This repository contains the source code of the PenguorHS compiler for the Penguor language.

## Overview

Penguor is an in-development data-oriented language. Currently, it is in a very early stage and it does not have many features yet. The ultimate goal is to create a fast, feature-rich language optimized for games and other applications which need to handle lots of data.

Work-in-progress documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/Penguor/PenguorDocs).

## Roadmap

we have a trello board at Trello: https://trello.com/b/YG8mjZu3
